Inspect the actual repository changes. Specifically test the design mentally against:
- unauthorized or confused-deputy access;
- partial failure and retries;
- concurrent operations and idempotency;
- data loss and rollback;
- incompatible schema or public API changes;
- secret leakage and unsafe logging;
- unavailable or slow external services;
- deployment and downgrade behavior.

Do not edit files. Return only JSON conforming to the supplied schema.
